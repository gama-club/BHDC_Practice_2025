# Practicing for the Big Health Data Case Comp 2025
Hello! This repo contains GAMA members' practice work. We've set up 4 private kaggle comps, and we'll be uploading everything here.

## If you're a GAMA member

Please upload your code whenever you can! Collaboration will be very helpful.

When you upload, please do it in the directory associated with the Kaggle comp you're competing in. Additionally, please **make a sub-directory with your name** to upload your code.

You can see how this has been done in each of the 4 competition directories for Christian Geils

Thanks and have fun!
